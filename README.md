Crop Yield Prediction using Deep Learning

This repository contains code and data for a deep learning model that predicts crop yields based on environmental and soil data. The model is trained using a dataset of historical crop yields, weather data, and soil data for a specific region.
Data

The data used for this project is a combination of historical crop yield data, weather data, and soil data. The crop yield data is sourced from the kaggle  and covers a 10-year period for a specific region.
Model

The crop yield prediction model is built using a deep learning approach, specifically a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network. The model takes in environmental and soil data as input and outputs a predicted crop yield. The model is trained on the historical crop yield, weather, and soil data to learn the patterns and relationships between the input features and the target output.
Usage

To use the model, simply run the crop_yield_prediction.py script and provide the necessary input data in the form of a CSV file. The script will output a predicted crop yield for the given input data.
Dependencies

The code in this repository requires the following dependencies:

    TensorFlow
    NumPy
    Pandas

These can be installed using pip install or any other package manager.
